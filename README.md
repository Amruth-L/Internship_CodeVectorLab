 ProductVault

ProductVault is a full-stack, modern web application for managing and browsing a product catalog. The project features a sleek, responsive user interface with real-time search, category filtering, and sorting, powered by a robust Express and PostgreSQL backend.

 Architecture

The project has been refactored into a decoupled architecture with cleanly separated frontend and backend environments.

- /frontend : Contains the React application powered by Vite and styled purely with Tailwind CSS v4.
- /backend : Contains the Node.js/Express server and PostgreSQL database integration logic.

 Getting Started

 Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
You will also need a PostgreSQL database. Ensure the `DATABASE_URL` is set inside `backend/.env`.

1. Backend Setup

Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd backend
```

Install backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Set up the database schema:
```bash
npm run migrate
```

(Optional) Seed the database with sample data:
```bash
npm run seed
```

Start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```
> The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:
```bash
cd frontend
```

Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the Vite development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
> The frontend application will start on `http://localhost:5173`. The Vite config is already set up to proxy `/api` requests automatically to the backend running on port 3000.
